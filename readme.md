## Understanding Problem Statement

Our Taks is to make a fully deployed webstie that will take various details from the used and then provide an accurate prediction of their scope of repaying the loan
We were give with up training data which is available at :- Task1DataSet. Website is accepting all the inputs in same fashion which is given in dataset


## Motive
In today‚Äôs world of recession and uncertain economy following the pandemic, it is vital to have healthy and sustainable financing no matter who you are. A big part in ensuring this is to stay clear of risky loan traps and prevent taking on unsustainable debts. A smart individual would diligently measure the amount and purpose of each loan against their own specific information to determine their ability to pay the loan back. There is certainly a large scope for programs and algorithms that can help in making this decision with high accuracy.

<!-- ## Why Streamlit?
Streamlit is a free and open-source framework to rapidly build and share beautiful machine learning and data science web apps. It is a Python-based library specifically designed for machine learning engineers. Data scientists or machine learning engineers are not web developers and they're not interested in spending weeks learning to use these frameworks to build web apps. Instead, they want a tool that is easier to learn and to use, as long as it can display data and collect needed parameters for modeling. Streamlit allows you to create a stunning-looking application with only a few lines of code.

Streamlit is the easiest way especially for people with no front-end knowledge to put their code into a web application:

- No front-end (html, js, css) experience or knowledge is required.
- You don't need to spend days or months to create a web app, you can create a really beautiful machine learning or data science app in only a few hours or even minutes.
- It is compatible with the majority of Python libraries (e.g. pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex)).
- Less code is needed to create amazing web apps.
- Data caching simplifies and speeds up computation pipelines. -->

## Set Up For Development

AILOEC was build over python version 3.7.6. But all the library supports any python version >=3.7.6. All other library's are available in requirements.txt which can be installed via command below. The API needs a seperate start if needed to start api over development server. Follow the steps mentioned in respected part. If any bug irritates you feel free raise a issue.

### Install packages or API:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start Local Server For API Testing:

```
$ uvicorn mlapi:app --reload
```

For Testing The API different ways can be used either you can download PostMan Community Version for testing. Once you start the local server just add a route "\predict" at the end of your local host link. It might look as well

```
$ https:\\{Your IP}\predict
```

It requires a header which contains different details which will be given as user input via website and these will be used to predict the possiblity of fraud or not-fraud. A sample header which might look as follows:-

```
{
    "NPPM": 1,
    "LoanStatus": "existing loans paid back duly till now",
    "Objective": "Purchase of radio/television",
    "Amount": 1278,
    "Guarantee": "none",
    "Experience": "between 1 and 4 years",
    "M_Status": "male and single",
    "ExistingLoan": 1,
    "Age": 36,
    "CA_Balance": "no current account",
    "SA_Balance": "less than 100",
    "PI_Balance": 4,
    "WorkAB": "Yes",
    "PhNum": 0,
    "Tenure": 24,
    "prop": "Real Estate",
    "JobTyp": "management/ self-employed/highly qualified employee/ officer",
    "HouseT": "own",
    "NOE": 1
}
```


### Start Website on LocalHost For Testing:

Pre-requiste you should have node installed and setup complted on your system to run AILOEC on your local system 

```
$ npm install root_dir/main_dir
```

```
$ npm run dev
```
